Dynamixel Motors 
================
All code for testing, calibrating, and controlling the Dynamixel motors which Abi uses. 

## WHAT TO DO üßê
Use the **template.py** file to write/add your code for Abi's Dynamixel motors (note. may need to change the control table values depending on the motors you are using). 

The (obviously) main script in this repo is **main.py**. This script currently include functions that allow you to enable/disable the torque on a specific motor, and actuate a motor to a specific position. 

How to run the script:
```bash 
python3 main.py
```
