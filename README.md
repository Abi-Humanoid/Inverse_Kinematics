Forward and Inverse Kinematics
================
FK and IK scripts, including integration with Dynamixels

## Dynamixel_testing
Scripts to read all motors in the lower body, and write to all motors to change their position. 'Moving_legs_IK' contains the functions for inverse kinematics that translates to the motors, and 'testing_dynamixel_IK' will run these functions using randomly generated z and y co-ordinate for the left and right feet.

## Kinematics
Contains the important files being used for foward and inverse kinematics. 'TestingFK...' or 'TestingIK' scripts will run the functions contained in the equivalent 'SetupJoints' script. See the first comment at the top of each script for more info on that individual script. 

## testing
Contains old files that were tested.
